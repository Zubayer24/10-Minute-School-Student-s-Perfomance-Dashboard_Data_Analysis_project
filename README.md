The dashboard is designed to help educators quickly identify improvement areas, declining performance, and top-performing students.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze daily exam attempts and attendance behavior
- Track pass rate trends over time
- Identify students who improved or declined between attempts
- Highlight exams with notable performance drops
- Summarize second-attempt improvements
- Provide actionable insights for academic decisions
